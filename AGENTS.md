# Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that produce
open source RabbitMQ releases.

## Workflows

The workflows under `.github/workflows` are structured like so:

 * There are several RabbitMQ release series
 * For each series, there are workflows for alpha, beta, RC and GA releases
 * All workflows share some common parts, most importantly `.github/workflows/reusable-release-workflow.yml` 
 * New alpha releases trigger [Jepsen test suite](https://github.com/rabbitmq/jepsen): `.github/workflows/reusable-trigger-jepsen-tests-workflow.yml` 
 

## Comments

 * Only add very important comments, both in tests and in the implementation

## Git Instructions

 * Never add yourself to the list of commit co-authors
 * Never mention yourself in commit messages in any way (no "Generated by", no AI tool links, etc)

## Style Guide

 * Never add full stops to Markdown list items
