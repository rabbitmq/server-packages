# Build Open Source RabbitMQ Packages on Actions

## Disclaimer

This subproject is very new. Things can break, documentation will be lacking,
design decisions will be revisited, and so on. Please do not rely on this repository
unless you plan to regularly contribute to RabbitMQ and have consulted with the RabbitMQ Core Team.

## What is This?

This repository is similar in purpose to [`rabbitmq/erlang-packages`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/erlang-packages)
but for RabbitMQ server packages.

This is a work-in-progress. Nothing to see here for now, move along.


## License

This repository is released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0,
same as open source RabbitMQ.
